<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>The doctor portal is to provide patients or any customer an easy way of booking a doctorâ€™s appointment online. This system offers an effective solution where customers can view many booking slots available and select the preferred date and time. The advantages of having such system are numerous. The patient will not have to wait in queue for hours to get the appointment. The task sometime becomes very tedious for the compounder and the doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the customers as per their availability.The appointments are simply made through the portal. Time management is very easy for both the doctors and patients.</p>
